		<h3>About</h3>

		<p>Started out at the <strong><em>National Organisation of Peer Educators (NOPE)</em></strong> in 2006, as a
			reproductive health trainer of trainer for the <strong><em>Ambassadors of Change (AOC)</em></strong> project
			and <strong><em>Responding to AIDS among the Youth (RAY)</em></strong>. At the same time, I was a member of
			<strong><em>Youth Peer Education Network-YPEER</em></strong>, an International network of reproductive health
			trainers. I then preceeded to shortly volunteered, at <strong><em>Population Service International (PSI)</em></strong>
			after leaving <strong><em>NOPE</em></strong> in 2008. At the organisation, I worked as a youth leader and
			trainer in primary schools, promoting abstinence as a way to prevent sexual reproductive ilnesses. This was
			through reproductive health clubs, called &quot;<strong><em>CHILL</em></strong>&quot; <em>(slung for wait)</em>
			or Abstinence Clubs.

			In February of the same year, I was invited by <strong><em>Y-PEER</em></strong>, to seat in a committee to help
			<strong><em>The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)</em></strong>, <strong><em>The Warner Bros</em></strong>
			and private partners including <strong><em>Coca Cola</em></strong>, to develop a reproductive health HIV&amp;AIDS
			educational video game, called <strong><em>Pamoja Mtaani</em></strong>.

			The same year, in October, I was invited by <strong><em>Y-PEER</em></strong> again, to represent African youths at
			the 30th Anniversary celebrations of <strong><em>The Alma Ata Declaration</em></strong> in Almaty, Kazakhstan.

			December 2008, I was contracted by <strong><em>The Warner Bros</em></strong> to train and manage 36 youth for game
			research for six months of the pilot phase of the video game testing, followed by nine more months of the implementation
			phase.

			In December 2009, I was invited to work with <strong><em>UNICEF New York &amp; Denmark</em></strong> offices, to organise
			and facilitate a children climate conference named <strong><em>UNICEF Children Climate Forum (CCF)</em></strong>, in
			Copenhagen Denmark. through this convention, &quot;<strong><em>Unite 4 Climate</em></strong>&quot;, a child lead advocacy
			and awareness campaign by <strong><em>UNICEF Zambia</em></strong>, was born. I was invited to consult for this program as a
			lead trainer. During this time, together with three other collegues, I successfully organised and managed three
			<strong><em>Zambian Children Climate Conference (ZCCC)</em></strong>, where more that 600 youth were trained on Climate Change
			advocacy and awareness; theatre; and multimedia campaigns over a period of three years. 60+ Climate Change campaigns in Zambias
			ten provinces started as a result. The project is now run by <strong><em>ZCCC</em></strong> I alumnus.

			June 2010, working for
			<a href="https://www.childrensradiofoundation.org" title="Childrens Radio Foundation Website" target="_blank">Children&apos;s Radio Foundation</a>
			I Coordinated <a href="https://youtu.be/ki2SpoaK7YE" title="World Cup In My Village Video" target="_blank">World Cup In my Village</a>,
			Zambia. This was the screenng of the first world cup in Africa, in remote villages of Zambia, and making radio shows out of the
			experience. From this, a network of youth reporters around the country, was born: The name, <strong><em>Youth Reporter Network (YRN)</em></strong>,
			Zambia. I trained these youth to produce radio programs, and use this in community dialogues. One of the
			<a href="https://soundcloud.com/childrensradiofoundation/floating-school" title="floating school audio" target="_blank">radio features</a>
			produced encouraged <strong><em>UNICEF Zambia</em></strong> to fundraise for the construction of a floating school in Mongu, a remote
			village, west of Zambia. During the same time, I initiated and consulted for a similar program in Tanzania:
			<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t8wX2zz0nQ" title="YRN Tanzania Video" target="_blank">Young Reporters Network Tanzania</a>.
			The project has 8 active sites in the country.

			<h3>Why Programming</h3>

			<p>After leaving the NGO world in 2015, I linked up with three interesting guys; Manuel Eshitera Akatsa, Robins Kiama Ngige and Lyosi Justin
				Mwedekeli; and  together we formed acollective named <a href="https://vimeo.com/hutcherystudios" title="Hutchery Studios Vimeo" target="_blank">Hutchery Studios</a>.
				The word, comes from the english word, <strong><em>&quot;Hatchery&quot;</em></strong>, a place where eggs hatch. Thus, at <strong><em>Hutchery Studios</em></strong>,
				we use digital audiovisual techniques, to document and present, stories of our time.
				<em>&quot;We like to think of ourselves as the audiovisual scribes of our time.&quot;</em></p>
