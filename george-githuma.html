			<h3>About</h3>

				<p>Started out at the <strong>National Organisation of Peer Educators (NOPE)</strong> in 2006, as a
					reproductive health trainer of trainer for the <strong>Ambassadors of Change (AOC)</strong> project
					and <strong>Responding to AIDS among the Youth (RAY)</strong>. At the same time, I was a member of
					<strong>Youth Peer Education Network-YPEER</strong>, an International network of reproductive health
					trainers. I then preceeded to shortly volunteered, at <strong>Population Service International (PSI)</strong>
					after leaving <strong>NOPE</strong> in 2008. At the organisation, I worked as a youth leader and
					trainer in primary schools, promoting abstinence as a way to prevent sexual reproductive ilnesses. This was
					through reproductive health clubs, called <strong>&quot;CHILL&quot;</strong> <em>(slung for wait)</em>
					or Abstinence Clubs.</p>

				<p>In February of the same year, I was invited by <strong>Y-PEER</strong>, to seat in a committee to help
					<strong>The U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)</strong>, <strong>The Warner Bros</strong>
					and private partners including <strong>Coca Cola</strong>, to develop a reproductive health HIV&amp;AIDS
					educational video game, called <strong>Pamoja Mtaani</strong>.</p>

				<p>The same year, in October, I was invited by <strong>Y-PEER</strong> again, to represent African youths at
					the 30th Anniversary celebrations of <strong>The Alma Ata Declaration</strong> in Almaty, Kazakhstan.</p>

				<p>December 2008, I was contracted by <strong>The Warner Bros</strong> to train and manage 36 youth for game
					research for six months of the pilot phase of the video game testing, followed by nine more months of the implementation
					phase.</p>

				<p>In December 2009, I was invited to work with <strong>UNICEF New York &amp; Denmark</strong> offices, to organise
					and facilitate a children climate conference named <strong>UNICEF Children Climate Forum (CCF)</strong>, in
					Copenhagen Denmark. through this convention, <strong>&quot;Unite 4 Climate&quot;</strong>, a child lead advocacy
					and awareness campaign by <strong>UNICEF Zambia</strong>, was born. I was invited to consult for this program as a
					lead trainer. During this time, together with three other collegues, I successfully organised and managed three
					<strong>Zambian Children Climate Conference (ZCCC)</strong>, where more that 600 youth were trained on Climate Change
					advocacy and awareness; theatre; and multimedia campaigns over a period of three years. 60+ Climate Change campaigns in Zambias
					ten provinces started as a result. The project is now run by <strong>ZCCC</strong> I alumnus.</p>

				<p>June 2010, working for
					<a href="https://www.childrensradiofoundation.org" title="Childrens Radio Foundation Website" target="_blank">Children&apos;s Radio Foundation</a>
					I Coordinated <a href="https://youtu.be/ki2SpoaK7YE" title="World Cup In My Village Video" target="_blank">World Cup In my Village</a>,
					Zambia. This was the screenng of the first world cup in Africa, in remote villages of Zambia, and making radio shows out of the
					experience. From this, a network of youth reporters around the country, was born: The name, <strong>Youth Reporter Network (YRN)</strong>,
					Zambia. I trained these youth to produce radio programs, and use this in community dialogues. One of the
					<a href="https://soundcloud.com/childrensradiofoundation/floating-school" title="floating school audio" target="_blank">radio features</a>
					produced encouraged <strong>UNICEF Zambia</strong> to fundraise for the construction of a floating school in Mongu, a remote
					village, west of Zambia. During the same time, I initiated and consulted for a similar program in Tanzania:
					<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t8wX2zz0nQ" title="YRN Tanzania Video" target="_blank">Young Reporters Network Tanzania</a>.
					The project has 8 active sites in the country.</p>

			<h3>Why Programming</h3>

				<p>After leaving the NGO world in 2015, I linked up with three interesting guys; Manuel Eshitera Akatsa, Robins Kiama Ngige and Lyosi Justin
					Mwedekeli; and  together we formed acollective named <a href="https://vimeo.com/hutcherystudios" title="Hutchery Studios Vimeo" target="_blank">Hutchery Studios</a>.
					The word, comes from the english word, <strong>&quot;Hatchery&quot;</strong>, a place where eggs hatch. Thus, at <strong>Hutchery Studios</strong>,
					we use digital audiovisual techniques, to document and present, stories of our time.</p>

				<p><em>&quot;We like to think of ourselves as the audiovisual scribes of our time.&quot;</em></p>

				<p>The studio currentltly has three departments:</p>

					<ol>

						<li><strong>Production</strong></li>

							<p>This department deals with the collection and archiving of audiovisual material for use by the post production department.
								This includes, but not limited to:</p>

								<ul>
										<li>Creating and shooting raw footage</li>
										<li>Creating and recording raw sound</li>
										<li>Creating and excecuting photo shoots</li>
								</ul>

						<li><strong>Post-Production</strong></li>

							<p>This department is the processing arm of the studio. This is where collected material is turned into something presentable
								like a movie, a documentary, a graphical presentation to name a few. Under this department, we have:</p>

								<ul>
										<li>Video editing-Collected footage is pieced together to tell a story</li>
										<li>Motion Graphics-Graphics including titles, subtiles and creadits are created to accompany the story</li>
										<li>Animation-2D&amp;3D animation are used to accompany a story or to tell the whole story</li>
								</ul>

						<li><strong>Live</strong></li>

							<p>This is a newly created department, where we broadcast content live on facebook. The broadcast is done regularly on the studios page
							<a href="https://www.facebook.com/HutcheryLive" title="Hutchery Live on Facebook" target="_blank">Hutchery live</a>.</p>
